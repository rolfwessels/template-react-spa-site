# Project Structure and Conventions

## Simplicity First Principle
**ALWAYS start with the simplest solution that works.**
- For CI/CD: Start with basic test + build, add complexity only when needed
- For features: Build minimal working version first, then iterate
- For configurations: Use minimal settings, avoid premature optimization
- For dependencies: Prefer fewer, well-established packages
- When in doubt, choose the simpler approach over the "complete" solution
- Remember: You can always add complexity later, but removing it is much harder

## Base Stack
- React 18+
- Vite for development and building
- Radix UI for accessible UI primitives
- TanStack Router for routing
- Vitest for testing
- graphql-codegen for type-safe GraphQL
- Zustand for state management (optional)

## Folder Structure
```
config/           # Contains the boilder plate config files
src/
  components/     # Radix-wrapped reusable components
  pages/          # App pages routed via TanStack Router
  hooks/          # Custom hooks
  lib/            # Utilities, clients, etc.
  graphql/        # (Optional) GraphQL fragments/clients
  styles/
  App.tsx
  main.tsx
```

## Key Conventions
- Use Radix UI components wherever possible, especially @radix-ui/themes
- Place reusable UI components in `components/`
- Keep change small and try to reduce complexity
- Code should be modular, typed (TS), and composable
- Write tests for every component where possible
- Use `pnpm` exclusively for package management
- Avoid custom styles, use Tailwind instead
- When working with graphql use the generated calls and interfaces `src/graphql/generated` and `src/graphql/interfaces`. Do not reinvent types everytime.

## Development Workflow
- Run `make test` after any UI component changes or test modifications
- Ensure all tests pass before committing changes
- Write tests alongside component development
- Follow TDD practices when possible
