## ❓ FAQ

### How do I update packages?

To safely update your project dependencies:

```bash
# 1. Check for outdated packages
pnpm outdated

# 2. Update packages (choose one approach)
pnpm update          # Update within semver ranges
pnpm update --latest # Update to latest versions (be careful!)

# 3. ALWAYS run tests after updating
make test

# 4. If tests pass, commit the changes
git add package.json pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "chore: update dependencies"
```

**⚠️ Important Notes:**
- Always run `make test` after updating packages to catch breaking changes
- Consider updating major versions one at a time for easier debugging
- Check the changelog of major version bumps before updating
- Test your app thoroughly in both development and production builds

### How do I add a new package?

```bash
# Add a runtime dependency
pnpm add package-name

# Add a dev dependency  
pnpm add -D package-name

# Don't forget to test!
make test
```

## 🔍 Things that we are working on

- [x] Better graphql integration (we want proper types)
- [ ] We want to use local storage as cache (load from cache > check server > update cache)
- [x] I don't like all the .config files in the root. Can we do something better?
